# ubiquitous-gearers-spinup-code
this is a repo for the code used by team 10478S 2022-2023

# currently
am using scurve motion profiles created by ryanlib which are followed using the PID controllers built into the motors

# in future
might create my own motion profiled path planner using quintic bezier splines and potentially increase accuracy using custom velocity controllers
potentially implement pure pursuit with odometry
